## 📜 SQL & Data Processing
To extract key insights, SQL queries were used for **data analysis and transformation**:

**1️⃣ Monthly Price Trends:**
```sql
SELECT YEAR(transaction_date) AS Year, MONTH(transaction_date) AS Month, AVG(price) AS AvgPrice
FROM RealEstateDB
GROUP BY Year, Month
ORDER BY Year, Month;
```
🔹 *Identifies seasonal patterns affecting real estate prices.*

**2️⃣ Top Property Hotspots:**
```sql
SELECT location, COUNT(*) AS TotalListings, AVG(price) AS AvgPrice
FROM RealEstateDB
GROUP BY location
ORDER BY TotalListings DESC;
```
🔹 *Pinpoints high-demand locations for strategic investments.*
