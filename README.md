# Tech Home Analyst Project

## Project Overview

This project focuses on **real estate price prediction** using machine learning and **business intelligence integration** via Power BI. The goal is to provide accurate property price estimates based on factors like house age, distance to MRT stations, and nearby amenities.

## Folder Contents

### 1. **Datasets & Data Analysis**

- `dataset.csv` - The main dataset containing house price information.
- `predictions.csv` - Model-generated price predictions.
- `summary of data.docx` - Summary statistics and key insights from the dataset.
- `Correlation Analysis of House Price.docx` - Analysis of correlations between house price, house age, and MRT station distance.
- `EDA_REPORT.ipynb` - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) notebook.

### 2. **Machine Learning Model**

- `tech_home_analytic_model.ipynb` - Jupyter Notebook for training the house price prediction model.
- `tech_home.joblib` - Saved machine learning model for deployment.
- `Model Testing.ipynb` - Notebook for testing the trained model.

### 3. **Power BI Dashboard**

- `House price prediction dashboard.pbix` - Power BI file for visualizing predictions and insights.

### 4. **Project Documentation**

- `Case Study.docx` - Business problem, objectives, and expected outcomes.
- `How This Shows Advanced Skills.docx` - Explanation of how the project showcases data science and BI expertise.

### 5. **Code & Scripts**

- `web.py` - Python script, possibly for web-based deployment.
- `templates/` - Contains additional resources for visualization or reporting.

## How to Use This Project

1. **Data Exploration**: Start with `EDA_REPORT.ipynb` to understand the dataset.
2. **Model Training & Testing**: Use `tech_home_analytic_model.ipynb` and `Model Testing.ipynb` to train and evaluate the model.
3. **Predictions**: The trained model's predictions are in `predictions.csv`.
4. **Power BI Integration**: Open `House price prediction dashboard.pbix` in Power BI to visualize results.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Power BI Desktop
- Required Python libraries (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, joblib, matplotlib, seaborn)

## Conclusion
